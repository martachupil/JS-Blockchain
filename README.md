# JavaScript Blockchain

A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
which are linked and secured simultaneously using cryptography.
Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. 
By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.
